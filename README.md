# Database Notes
What Is a Database?
>An organized collection of structured info/data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
>
>Data in most of databases is modelled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient

What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?
>A programming language used by most relation databases to query, manipulate, define data, and provide access control

Whatâ€™s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?
>Spreadsheets are designed for one to few users
>>Good for when you don't require alot of data manipulation
>
>Databases are meant for *larger*, *massive* amounts of information. 
>>Multiple users can securely and quikcly access and query the data at the same time using highly complex logic and language


Types of databases
>Relational databases
>>Most efficient and flexible way to access structured info
>
>Object-oriented databases
>>Represented in form of objects
>
>Distributed databases
>>Consists of 2 or more files located in different sites
>
>Data warehouses
>>A central repository for data
>
>NoSQL databases
>>Also known as nonrelational database
>>
>>Allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated
>>
>>Grew popular as web applications have become more complex
>
>Graph databases
>>Stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between the entities
>
>OLTP Databases
>>Analytic, speedy database meant for large number of transactions between multiple users
>
>Some of the latest databases which are less common are open source databases, cloud databases, multimodel databases, document/JSON database, and self-driving databases

What is database software?
>Creates, edits, maintains database files and records
>
>Enables easy file and record creation, data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting
>
>Handles data storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security
>
>Usually has a graphical interface

What is a database management system (DBMS)?
>Serves as an interface between the database and its end users or pgrograms, allowing users to retrieve, update, ad manage how the info is organized and optimized
>
>Enables a variety of administrative options
>
>Examples: MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database

What is a MySQL database?
>An open source relational database management system based on SQL
>
>Designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform
>
>Primary feature: on-demand flexibility
>
>DBMS of FaceBook, Twitter, Youtube, and more

Database challenges
>Absorbing significant increase in data volume
>
>Ensuring data security
>
>Keeping up with demand
>
>Managing and maintainging the database and infrastructure
>
>Remove limits on scalability
>
>Ensuring data residency, data sovereignty, or latency requirements
